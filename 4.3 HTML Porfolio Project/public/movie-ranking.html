       <h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
       <h2>My top three favorites movies this year so far.</h2> 
       <hr>
       <h3>The King of Comedy</h3>
       <p>I really liked Robert DeNiro's role as an uncomfortable little obsessed freak.</p>
       <h3>La Haine</h3>
       <p>This movie, although 30 years old, portrays the crude reality of police brutality and riots today.</p>
       <h3>Poor Things</h3>
       <p>The set design, photography direction and production alone makes this film a must watch for everyone.</p>
